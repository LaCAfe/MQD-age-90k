# MQD-age-90k
This data set consists of 93,638 entries from a social network where users write predominantly in Brazilian Portuguese. 

It is divided into three classes: 10, 20, and 30, containing users of both genders with ages between 13 and 17, 23 to 27, and 33 to 42 years, respectively. 
The 6-year interval between the end of an age range and the beginning of another was planned for a clearer differentiation.
